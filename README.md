# Shoe shopping application using Flutter

🤖👋 Hey there!

As part of my Flutter personal projects, I developed a shopping app for some practice. It was a great opportunity for me to explore different widgets in flutter.
Overall, I'm pretty excited about how this project turned out and I hope you will find it interesting too! ❤️
